# ScaleWorks

A web app to manage scale-modelling work: track finished and in-progress models, quotes, the parts and consumables they need, and the hours spent on each build.

> Status: planning. No application code yet.

## Goals

- Create, browse and edit every model I build, for clients or for myself.
- Keep quotes alongside finished work, and turn an accepted quote into a model with one action.
- Know what I need to buy, what is already ordered, and what I already have.
- Log time per model, adding a little each day.
- Work well on both desktop and mobile. On mobile, browsing and logging hours come first, but everything must be available.

## Features

- **Models**: client, parts, consumables used, price, phase, dates and total hours.
- **Quotes**: client, price, optional part list with store links, and optional links to past models marked as "same" or "similar".
- **Quote to model**: an accepted quote becomes a model, carrying over its data.
- **Parts**: model-specific components (the kit, a light bar, etc.) with purchase status.
- **Consumables**: general supplies shared across models (thinner, primer, some paints) with purchase status.
- **Clients**: name, contact and optional company.
- **Time tracking**: add hours per day to a model (1h today, +2h tomorrow); the total is the sum of all entries.
- **Multi-user**: each user has their own account and only sees their own data.

## Data model

### Client
| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| name | required |
| contact | required |
| company | optional |

### Part (specific to one model or quote)
| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| brand | |
| reference | |
| description | short |
| price | |
| store / link | store name or online shop URL |
| status | `To order`, `Ordered`, `In hand` |

### Consumable (general, reusable)
| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| store | |
| description | |
| price | |
| reference | optional |
| status | `To order`, `Ordered`, `In hand` |

### Model
| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| client | |
| parts | list of parts |
| consumables | list of consumables used |
| price | |
| phase | see below |
| requested date | date given by the client |
| estimated date | my own estimate |
| time entries | list of `date` + `hours`; total hours is derived |

Phases: `Not started` → `Pending decal design` → `Pending painting` → `Pending decals` → `Pending varnish` → `Pending assembly` → `Finished`.

### Quote
| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| client | |
| parts | optional list, with store links |
| price | |
| related models | optional links to past models, marked `same` or `similar` |

Converting a quote creates a model that reuses its client, parts and price.

## Tech stack (proposed)

- **App**: Next.js (TypeScript), responsive UI, installable as a PWA on mobile.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Neon (free tier).
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier). Note that the free Hobby plan is for non-commercial use.
- **Auth**: email-based accounts, with every record scoped to its owner.

## Getting started

Planned once the project is scaffolded: prerequisites, install, environment variables and run instructions.

## Roadmap

1. MVP: clients, models, parts, consumables, time entries.
2. Quotes and quote-to-model conversion, with links to similar past models.
3. Purchase overview: everything still `To order` across models.
4. Polish for mobile (PWA install, quick hour logging).
